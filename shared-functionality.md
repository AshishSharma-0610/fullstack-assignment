## 1. Implementing Shared Functionality Across a Component Tree

To efficiently share functionality across a React component tree, you can use the following approaches:

### Lifting State Up
This technique involves moving the state to the closest common ancestor of the components that need to share it. By passing the state and any necessary functions as props, you ensure that the child components have access to the same piece of data, allowing them to function cohesively.

#### Example:
```javascript
function ParentComponent() {
    const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useState('');

    return (
        <div>
            <ChildComponent1 sharedState={sharedState} setSharedState={setSharedState} />
            <ChildComponent2 sharedState={sharedState} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

In this example, `sharedState` is maintained in the `ParentComponent` and passed down to `ChildComponent1` and `ChildComponent2`, allowing both to use and modify the same state.


### Context API
The Context API allows you to create a global state that can be accessed by any component within the context's provider, without needing to manually pass props through every level. This is especially useful for larger applications where state needs to be widely shared across many components.

#### Example:
```javascript
const SharedContext = React.createContext();

function ParentComponent() {
    const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useState('');

    return (
        <SharedContext.Provider value={{ sharedState, setSharedState }}>
            <ChildComponent1 />
            <ChildComponent2 />
        </SharedContext.Provider>
    );
}

function ChildComponent1() {
    const { sharedState, setSharedState } = useContext(SharedContext);
}
```
Here, the `SharedContext` allows `ChildComponent1` and `ChildComponent2` to access and modify the shared state directly, making it easier to manage complex data flows.
